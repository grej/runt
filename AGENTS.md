# AI Agent Development Context

This document provides context for AI assistants working on the runt runtime
agent library.

## Project Overview

Runt is a TypeScript/Deno library for building runtime agents that connect to
[Anode notebooks](https://github.com/rgbkrk/anode). It uses LiveStore for
event-sourcing and real-time sync between multiple users.

**Current Status**: Working system with 29 passing tests. Core functionality is
implemented and published to JSR. The system is a working prototype with Python
execution via Pyodide, real-time collaboration, and executable installation
support.

## Architecture

- **Schema Package** (`@runt/schema`): LiveStore schema definitions with
  TypeScript types
- **Library Package** (`@runt/lib`): Runtime agent implementation with lifecycle
  management
- **Pyodide Package** (`@runt/pyodide-runtime-agent`): Python runtime using
  Pyodide with IPython integration for rich display support
- **LiveStore**: Event-sourcing framework for local-first apps with real-time
  sync
- **Deno**: TypeScript runtime with built-in testing and formatting

## What Actually Works

- LiveStore integration with event-sourced state management
- Runtime agent lifecycle (start, execute, shutdown)
- Jupyter-compatible output system (stdout, stderr, rich display data)
- Real-time collaboration via LiveStore sync
- CLI configuration with environment variable fallbacks
- Cross-package TypeScript imports with proper typing
- CI/CD pipeline with multi-platform testing
- Python code execution via Pyodide with rich formatting
- Direct Python code execution with IPython rich formatting
- HTML rendering, pandas tables, matplotlib SVG plots
- Real-time interrupt support via SharedArrayBuffer
- JSR publishing for all packages with executable installation
- Global executable installation as `pyrunt`

## What Needs Work

- Pyodide package loading can be slow on first run
- Available Python packages are constrained by Pyodide ecosystem
- Publishing requires `--allow-slow-types` flag due to LiveStore's complex types

## Development Workflow

The user typically runs:

```bash
deno task ci        # lint, format, type-check, test
deno task test      # just run tests
deno task dev       # run example echo agent
```

When making changes:

1. **Always create a branch first** - never commit directly to `main`
2. Edit code
3. Run `deno task ci` to check everything
4. Commit changes with focused, descriptive messages
5. Push branch and create PR
6. GitHub Actions runs the same checks

## Key Constraints

- **LiveStore Materializers**: Must be pure functions. Never use `ctx.query()`
  in materializers - it causes hash mismatches and runtime failures.
- **Event Schema**: Events can't be removed once added. Changes must be backward
  compatible.
- **Session Management**: Each runtime restart gets a unique `sessionId`. Handle
  session overlap during restarts.
- **Output Timing**: Use the ExecutionContext output methods (`stdout`,
  `stderr`, `display`, `result`, `error`, `clear`) for real-time output during
  execution.
- **Pyodide Code Execution**: Use direct `pyodide.runPythonAsync()` instead of
  IPython's `shell.run_cell()` to avoid code transformations. Process results
  through IPython's displayhook for rich formatting.
- **Duplicate Outputs**: When displayhook handles a result, don't return data
  from the execution handler to avoid duplicate execute_result outputs.

```

## Common Issues

**LiveStore "materializer hash mismatch"**: Caused by non-deterministic
materializers. All data needed by materializers must be in the event payload,
not queried during materialization.

**Import errors**: Make sure all imports use the workspace aliases
(`@runt/schema`, `@runt/lib`) or relative paths correctly.

**Test permissions**: Tests need
`--allow-env --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write --allow-sys` flags.

**Publishing**: Requires `--allow-slow-types` flag due to LiveStore's complex
types.

**Duplicate execute results**: When using IPython's displayhook for formatting,
don't return data from the execution handler.

## Testing

- **Unit tests**: Core functionality in `src/`
- **Integration tests**: Cross-package interactions in `test/`
- **Example tests**: Ensure examples work in `examples/`

Run tests with:
`deno test --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write --allow-sys`

## Dependencies

- `@livestore/livestore`: Event-sourcing framework
- `@livestore/adapter-node`: Node.js platform adapter
- `@livestore/sync-cf`: Cloudflare Workers sync backend
- `@std/cli`: Deno standard library for CLI parsing
- `@opentelemetry/api`: Structured logging and tracing
- `pyodide`: Python runtime in WebAssembly (for pyodide package)

All dependencies are pinned in `deno.json` import maps.

## Communication Style

- Be direct about what works and what doesn't
- Don't oversell capabilities or use marketing language
- Focus on helping developers solve actual problems
- It's okay to say "this is a prototype" or "this part needs work"
- Code examples are better than long explanations
- Keep documentation concise and consolidate when possible
- Remove marketing fluff and focus on technical accuracy
- Don't claim things "need work" without specific evidence
- Position this as a working prototype, not a production system

## Development Guidelines

- **Always work on a branch** - never commit directly to `main`
- Follow existing code patterns
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation when adding features
- Use TypeScript strictly - fix all type errors
- Follow Deno formatting conventions (`deno fmt`)
- Keep commits focused and descriptive
- Squash related commits before merging to keep history clean

## For AI Assistants

When working on this codebase:

- **Create a branch first** - never work directly on `main`
- Read the existing code to understand patterns
- Run tests after making changes
- Check that CI passes before submitting
- Don't make assumptions about complex LiveStore behavior
- Ask for clarification if event-sourcing concepts are unclear
- Focus on making the code work reliably rather than adding features
- Be honest about limitations and current state
- Avoid marketing language - this is a prototype for developers

The goal is to make this library useful for developers building runtime agents,
not to impress anyone with complexity.

## Recent Changes
